# GitDiff4Review
GitDiff4Review is a tool designed to simplify code reviews by generating comprehensive git diffs between two commits, branches, or pull requests. It combines diffs into a single output file that is optimized for consumption by large language models (LLMs) or for manual code review purposes.
